                The Doctor of Ministry (D.Min), Doctorate in Theology (Th.D), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D), 
                and Doctor of Divinity (DD) are the highest professional degrees for those in parish or related ministries. 
                These programs are designed for educated, experienced practitioners of the Christian faith who desire renewal 
                in themselves and their ministries through advanced training, research, and reflection.

                Our program specializes in deep personal and ministry transformation — equipping leaders to remain effective, 
                spiritually alert, and aligned with God’s purpose for their lives and ministries.

            <p>
                The Doctorate degree is an advanced professional program created for ongoing development in vocational ministry.
                It enhances professional competence by expanding theological foundations and ministry experience, enabling 
                graduates to strengthen current skills, address weaknesses, and increase overall effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                This program is open to ministerial leaders worldwide who meet the qualifications for admission and are
