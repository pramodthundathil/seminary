                The ultimate aim and vision to start Trinity Theological Seminary is to train the leaders equipping them
                in His Word to be effective Ministers of Gospel. Our desire is "TTS will provide the best biblical
                education at the most affordable price."
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a nonprofit organization which offers significantly
                lower tuition than most traditional universities and for-profit schools with similar programming. We
                work with all of our students as close as we can to meet their particular budget.

                Keep in mind that these tuition costs are prior to factoring in any grants, discounts or tuition
                assistance. With available grants, the payment for most students taking 4-5 courses per enrollment
                period is between $100 and $150.00 a month depending upon degree level.
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep costs low, Trinity offers its own financing for students through deferred payments on the
                remaining balance of their tuition and fees not paid at the time of enrollment.
