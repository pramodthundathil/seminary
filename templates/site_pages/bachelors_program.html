                The Graduate Certificate in Ministry is a One-year Bible training program. 
                The aim of the graduate certificate is to equip candidates with a non-theology background 
                to prepare themselves for postgraduate study as a means of developing research skills 
                appropriate to theology and divinity. The Graduate Certificate of Ministry requires 16 credit 
                points for graduation. The aim of the course is to guide students in a systematic manner to the 
                acquisition of the body of coherent knowledge that is the classical discipline of theology as a 
                means not only of preparing men and women for the responsibility of communicating Christian 
                knowledge but also for advanced degrees in theology and ministry.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition consideration will also be given to other factors such as maturity and motivation, 
                and the likelihood of satisfactory completion of the academic requirements of the course. 
                Students may articulate to the Graduate Diploma of Divinity or Graduate of Divinity or Master 
                of Divinity.
